    "## Note on Simulation Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots presented in this report illustrate the results of one specific run of the simulation model. Due to the stochastic nature of the model, which incorporates random elements such as agent initialization, movement, and resource availability, the outcomes may vary with each execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, while these plots provide insights into the dynamics of the wolf-sheep population model, they should be interpreted as examples of potential scenarios rather than definitive results. Repeating the simulation multiple times can yield different trajectories and behaviors, highlighting the variability and complexity of the model.\n"

    "### Persistence of Running Logs and Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that running logs and plots generated during the simulation in Jupyter notebooks may not persist after the notebook is closed and reopened. This behavior is due to the following reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "**State Management**: Jupyter does not automatically retain the state of widgets or variable outputs upon reopening a notebook. Each time the notebook is opened, it starts a new session, and any previously generated outputs need to be re-executed to regenerate plots and logs."
